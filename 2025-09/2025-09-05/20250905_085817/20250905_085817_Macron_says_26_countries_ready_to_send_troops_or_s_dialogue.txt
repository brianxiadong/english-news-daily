**Speaker 1:** Hello everyone! I’m happy to bring you this important news from Europe today.

**Speaker 2:** Hi there! In, thank you for bringing this up.

**Speaker 1:** In today's hot news summary, we have some exciting developments related to the EU and Ukraine. Let’s dive right into it.

**Speaker 2:** Absolutely, let’s get started.

**Speaker 1:** Macron addressed a global audience last night, and he emphasized that the EU can provide support to Ukraine without resorting to military intervention. What do you think about that?

**Speaker 2:** That sounds like a very important point. I agree with his perspective that the EU should prioritize diplomacy and cooperation over military action.

**Speaker 1:** Yeah, exactly. There are some countries, including Germany, who have already expressed willingness to send troops or provide financial aid to Ukraine. Do you think these efforts will be successful?

**Speaker 2:** It depends on the coordination of member states. If everyone works together effectively, it could be a viable solution. But it’s important to consider the potential consequences for both Europe and Russia.

**Speaker 1:** The EU-Troop Capacity is another topic that comes up in this development. Are you aware of how many troops each country can provide?

**Speaker 2:** I’m not quite sure about the exact numbers, but generally, the EU aims to have enough troops to support its member states. It’s important for all countries to contribute what they can.

**Speaker 1:** Well, that’s a good point. The potential impact of Macron's speech on Russia’s strategic posture is also discussed. What do you think about that?

**Speaker 2:** I agree with your concern about the implications for Russia. If Ukraine becomes independent from Russia, it could strain relations between these two major powers. It’s important for both sides to maintain diplomatic ties and avoid military confrontation.

**Speaker 1:** Absolutely, let's keep an eye on this situation. We need to make sure that everyone is working together to ensure a successful response to Ukraine.

**Speaker 2:** Definitely. I’m looking forward to hearing more from you about this news.

**Speaker 1:** Thanks for listening, everyone! Let’s stay informed and engaged in the ongoing discussions.

**Speaker 2:** You’re welcome! If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.
